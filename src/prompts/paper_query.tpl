Note:
1. Don't just focus on the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion sections of the paper; read the whole paper carefully.
2. Answers should be concise, informative, accurate and insightful - not simply a copy-paste of the paper.
3. Please assume that readers have some basic knowledge of the field and the paper, but are not necessarily experts in it.
4. The user is interested in both the results of the paper as well as details about its method and process for achieving those results.
5. If any answers are similar to previous ones, please refer to them instead of repeating them again.
6. If a question is not applicable to the paper, you can omit it.
7. If you're unsure about an answer, omit it - never make one up!
8. Format your answer using Markdown style formatting. You must use LaTeX for mathematical equations, $E=mc^2$ for inline equations and $$y = \sum x$$ for block equations.
9. The origin paper are invisible to the user, only your answers will be presented. So by default, you answers should be self-contained and understandable without reading the paper, but you can refer to the paper if you think it's necessary.
